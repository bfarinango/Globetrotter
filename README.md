### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I felt unprepared to complete the CSS portion of the project. I had a lot of trouble with the Flex features, but I was provided with resources that ultimately helped me understand everything.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have improved the UI/UX of the pages and implemented a map feature that shows the pinned locations of each place.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think my overall design choices, like the color palette and hover features, went well. Everything went as planned, but I probably would spend more time talking about each unique feature I implemented. One of my peers implemented a song into their web page, and it's something 
I would love to learn how to do.
